## Blackjack Project

#### Skill Distillery week 4 Homework

#### Overview

I created a simplistic Blackjack that implements the rules of Blackjack.

#### How to play
The player is asked if he/she would like to play (Y or N). If yes, the game starts and cards are dealt to the player and the dealer. One of the dealer cards are shown along with both of the player cards. If the dealer cards are less than 17, dealer must take another card. If this total is more than the player total and not over 21, the dealer wins. If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins.

#### Technologies Used

* Enums
* Java
* Object Oriented 
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation

#### Lessons Learned

I learned how to create and implement an interface, build and extend classes who's fields are objects, that call methods form other classes. I used collections.shuffle and loops for game logic.
